  <h3>About</h3>
  Developer excited to be join an environment where I can be tested and follow a lead engineer to become part of a team that builds meaningful projects. I am a quick learner in any environment and always pumped to recruit knowledge I pick up on the job. Constantly looking for the most efficient way to get something done and unafraid to take non-traditional routes towards an end goal.
